## 📊 Project Overview
The analysis focuses on:  
- Studying bike rental trends across **seasons, weekdays, and holidays**  
- Measuring the effect of **weather conditions** on rentals  
- Detecting **outliers and correlations** among key variables  
- Performing **hypothesis testing** (t-tests, ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-Square)  
- Providing **data-driven recommendations** for Yulu’s business growth

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills
- **Python** → Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Statistics** → T-tests, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-Square tests  
- **EDA & Visualization** → Histograms, heatmaps, scatter plots, boxplots

## 🔑 Key Insights
- 🍂 **Fall & Summer seasons** recorded the highest rentals, while Spring had the lowest.  
- ⏰ **Weekdays vs. weekends** showed no significant difference in rental counts.  
- 🌦️ **Weather strongly influences demand** — rentals dropped sharply during bad weather.  
- 📉 Outliers existed in **windspeed, casual, and registered users**.  
- 📊 Statistical tests confirmed **demand is not the same across seasons and weather conditions**.
